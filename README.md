prototype spotify bot



spotify slack bot, the wrong way.
basicly a slack 'parser', uses the slack api, the spotify web api, and
the spotify node api. Aswell as express to catch our authentication
token ( who knew you could miss oath?)

-> Needs a slack bot configured in your local slack settings, and needs
the personal/secret keys of spotify and its good to go. Right now you
can add songs to a playlist, and use the web interface to see the
playlist in action. Needs a lot of css work still.

Also, replace the playlist ID & USER ID for the playlist in the spotifyTest.js and webjs.js
